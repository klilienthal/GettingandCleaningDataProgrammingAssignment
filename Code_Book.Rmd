# About the variables

## Column 1: Activity
Describes what activity the subject was doing. This could be laying down, sitting, standing, walking, walking up stairs, or walking down stairs.

## Column 2: Subject ID
This is a number ranging from 1 through 30 identifying the subject being observed.

## Columns 3:88: Means
The remaining columns in the data frame are the means on each variable for each subject on each activity. For example "tBodyAccmeanX" represents the mean body acceleration on the x-axis. The first observation of this variable is the mean body acceleration on the x-axis for subject 1 in a laying down position.
